.. _structure:

The goal of this project is to provide a code infrastructure using Spack
pipeline feature to test on LC machines any Spack environment of interest for
RADIUSS.

As a side effect, those pipelines can be used to populate a build cache. This
usage will also be documented.


=========
Structure
=========

There are two main parts in this projects:
* The gitlab CI configuration, consisting of YAML files. The parent file is
  ``.gitlab-ci.yml`` and points to sub-parts in ``.gitlab`` using local
  ``includes``.
* The spack environments, each one defined in a subdirectory of
  ``spack-environments``.


GitLab CI configuration
=======================

Variables
---------

In ``.gitlab-ci.yml`` we find some global variables. Those are providing default
values that can be modified in GitLab UI. Variables will propagate to all the
jobs of the pipeline, but not jobs of child pipelines.

..note: We have child pipelines generated by Spack in this CI configuration.
global variables defined in ``.gitlab-ci.yml`` are not automatically transmitted
to the child pipelines.

Among those variables, the user may want to change the value of:
* ``MY_SPACK_REPO``: the repo used to download Spack
* ``MY_SPACK_COMMIT``: the commit in Spack repo that will be checked out.
* ``MY_SPACK_BRANCH``: the branch in Spack repo that will be checked out (if
  ``MY_SPACK_COMMIT`` is not set).
* ``MY_SPACK_DEBUG``: a placeholder to turn on/off spack debug traces.
* ``MY_ENV_NAME``: the name of the environment to concretize, build and test.

To modify any of these variables, it is recommended to use either CI variables
in Gitlab settings UI, or Pipeline variables found in GitLab pipelines and
schedules UI.

Stages
------

A pipeline is organized in stages. We start by downloading Spack, then we
generate the pipelines for the selected environment, on Quartz and Lassen.
Generation jobs will produce another Gitlab CI YAML file that will be
interpreted as a child pipeline in the build phase. Once all the builds
are complete, we do some clean-up.

Job templates
-------------

``.on-quartz`` and ``.on-lassen`` are job templates. They set basic requirements
shared by all the jobs that will extend them. Here any job running on Quartz or
on Lassen should ``extend`` the appropriate template.

Jobs
----

Jobs are top-level YAML sections that do not have a protected meaning in Gitlab
CI syntax. ``get-spack`` and ``rm-spack`` are jobs, as well as ``generate-on-quartz``
in ``.gitlab/generate.yml``.

``build-on-quartz`` in particular is a ``trigger`` job (it has a trigger sub-key).
It takes a GitLab YAML file describing a pipeline and will trigger it as child
pipeline of the current one.


Spack environments
==================

In the ``spack-environments directory``, each directory contains a Spack
environment.

Environment configuration
-------------------------

The core file is ``spack.yaml``, but we can split the environment configuration
using local "includes" (not to confuse with the GitLab CI includes).

A typical use of ``include`` is to provide the Spack configuration per machine:
In ``spack.yaml`` we find ``include: [$SYS_TYPE]``, where ``$SYS_TYPE`` will be
evaluated before the concretization. Depending on the machine we run on, the
environment will include the associated configuration, if an appropriate
sub-directory exists.

On Quartz, ``$SYS_TYPE`` will evaluate to ``toss_3_x86_64_ib`` while on Lassen it
will evaluate to ``blueos_3_ppc64le_ib_p9``.

Configuration can also be provided directly in the environment:

.. literalinclude:: ../../spack-environments/radiuss/toss_3_x86_64_ib/packages.yaml
   :start-after: [config-override--]
   :end-before: [--config-override]

Environment spec
----------------

We refer to ``Spack documentation on environments
<https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/environments.html#manually-editing-the-specs-list>``_
for the ``spec`` section of an environment.

CI configuration of an environment
----------------------------------

The ``gitlab-ci`` section of an environment is where we can customize the
behavior of the generated jobs. This has to be done coherently with `the
documentation provided by spack on the topic
<https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pipelines.html#a-pipeline-enabled-spack-environment>`_.


================================
Process to add a new environment
================================

The goal of this project is to be able to build any environment of interest for
RADIUSS, independently, and in a reproducible manner. We aim in particular at
building those environments against Spack develop branch to check that RADIUSS
packages do not get broken by recent changes in Spack.

The very first step is to make sure your environment can be built completely
isolated of any personnal Spack configuration, on LC systems. All the required
configuration needs to be embedded in the environment directory.

Then you need to add the ``gitlab-ci`` section to the ``spack.yaml`` file. This
should be doable by inspecting the existing radiuss environement. Create a Pull
Request and ask for help if needed.

Finally, adding an environment to the CI is easy. Most of the work being to
update in the UI the environment variables mentioned above.
